# Genetic-Algorith-Blackjack-Strategy
This project was submitted as my term project for the Introduction to Computer Programming in Engineering and Science course at Dawson College for the winter 2020 term.

#Task
The objective of my project was to develop a genetic algorithm that produces an optimized strategy for a simplified version of Blackjack and compare the performance of the algorithmically generated strategy compared to other strategies. Additonally, we were to write a scientific paper describing the process of developping our project as well as displaying and interpreting the results.
